## Energy Domain Full Stack Developer Code Challenge

Welcome to the Energy Domain code challenge. Here you will be able to show off your skills in a fun, creative way. Please attempt to have your challenge completed within a week. If something comes up and you need more time, reach out to Eric, otherwise please turn in what you have at the deadline. If you need any clarification, feel free to ask.
